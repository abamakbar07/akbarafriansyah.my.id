# Atlas Field Notes

## Problem

Teams were losing signal between qualitative research and operational dashboards. Insights lived in slides that were outdated before the next planning cycle.

## Approach

I designed a shared knowledge surface combining transcript snippets, instrumentation, and journey maps.

1. Built ingest pipelines that tag research clips automatically.
2. Crafted a cartography-inspired UI for navigating initiatives.
3. Embedded literacy prompts to help teams question their assumptions.<Footnote label="Prompts">Each question ends with “what evidence would change this view?”</Footnote>

## Result

Atlas Field Notes became the ritual for cross-functional reviews. Leadership now tracks narrative momentum alongside KPIs, keeping strategy grounded in human stories.
