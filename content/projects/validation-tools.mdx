These utilities are my secret weapon for catching anomalies faster than manual review. They parse bulk Excel reports, flag duplicated delivery orders, and highlight quantity mismatches across multiple systems.

## Toolkit

- Python scripts with Pandas for heavy data reshaping and anomaly detection.
- VBA macros embedded in warehouse spreadsheets for teams that live inside Excel.
- Configurable thresholds so each site can tailor alerts to its operational reality.

## Result

By automating validations, teams can focus on resolving root causes instead of combing through thousands of rows. It’s a quiet force multiplier for stock accuracy.
