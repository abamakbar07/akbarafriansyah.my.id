This tracker is my sandbox for blending data analytics habits with everyday money decisions. I wanted CSV/TSV imports that felt as simple as loading a SAP report and visualisations that made spending patterns obvious.

## Stack & features

- Next.js front-end with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive interface.
- Supabase authentication and Postgres database to store transactions securely.
- Automated categorisation rules powered by lightweight Python scripts.
- Snapshot exports so my family can review monthly summaries without logging in.

## Outcome

Beyond managing my own finances, the tracker has become a template for friends who want a calm, privacy-friendly alternative to mainstream finance apps.
