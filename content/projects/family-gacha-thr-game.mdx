Every Eid al-Fitr, my family looks forward to THR envelopes. I digitised the ritual with a gacha-style experience that keeps the suspense alive while making the distribution fair.

## Mechanics

- Guests spin a virtual wheel that maps to prepared envelopes.
- Admin panel to mark envelopes as claimed and redistribute extras.
- Lightweight deployment on Vercel so the game scales to family gatherings of any size.

## Takeaway

It’s proof that small, joyful tools can strengthen family bonds—and that software can be both functional and fun.
