StockFlow started as a practical response to nationwide Stock Take Operations (STO) across Ericsson deployments. I needed a way to pair SAP MM/WMS transactions with the realities happening on each warehouse floor.

## What it does

- Imports SAP MB52 snapshots and WMS exports, then highlights mismatches automatically.
- Guides field teams through STO checklists via an offline-capable PWA built with Next.js.
- Syncs findings back to a Supabase database so supervisors can prioritise follow-up actions.

## My role

I led the end-to-end build—from designing the warehouse-friendly interface to crafting Python ETL scripts and Supabase policies. The result is a calmer STO cycle where every stakeholder sees the same truth.

## Why it matters

The project keeps Ericsson’s inventory data trustworthy while reducing late-night reconciliations. It reflects my ethos: automate what feels repetitive and keep the human focus on thoughtful decisions.
