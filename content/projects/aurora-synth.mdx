# Aurora Synth

## Role and intent

I led product direction and interaction design. The goal was to help musicians translate daily journals into evolving soundscapes without needing a DAW.

## Process highlights

- Built a guided onboarding that pairs reflective prompts with tactile controls.
- Prototyped shader-driven visualizers that mirror musical layers.
- Conducted studio sessions with eight artists to stress-test the metaphors.<Footnote label="Artists">Indie musicians spanning ambient and downtempo scenes.</Footnote>

## Outcome

The tool now powers live performances and personal rituals. We continue to ship seasonal instrument packs shaped by community feedback.
