I built this template for friends and family who wanted a digital-first wedding experience. It pairs elegant typography with practical tooling that helps guests feel informed and hosts stay organised.

## Features

- Customisable themes with Tailwind CSS tokens for quick personalisation.
- RSVP flow connected to Supabase, including dietary preferences and seating notes.
- QR-based guest check-in that syncs to Google Sheets for easy exporting.

## Why I love it

It proves that thoughtful UX isn’t limited to corporate dashboards. Hospitality and logistics can share the same calm design language.
