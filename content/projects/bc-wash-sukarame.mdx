A family friend runs BC Wash Sukarame and needed clarity on busy hours, package uptake, and chemical usage. I designed a browser-based dashboard that pulls daily logs into an easy-to-read control panel.

## Highlights

- Data entry forms optimised for mobile so attendants can log services in seconds.
- Visual charts for hourly demand, team utilisation, and consumable spend.
- Automated reminders to reorder supplies before stockouts hit weekend peaks.

## Impact

The dashboard brings the same rigor I use in telecom logistics to a neighbourhood business, showing how thoughtful data tools can scale down as gracefully as they scale up.
