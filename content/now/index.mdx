# What I am focused on now

## Building

I am prototyping a lightweight "listening dashboard" for community managers. It blends anonymized sentiment signals with qualitative highlights so teams can respond with empathy.

## Learning

Exploring constraint-led choreography to inform motion patterns in future interfaces.

## Questioning

What rituals help people protect their attention without withdrawing from the communities they care about?
