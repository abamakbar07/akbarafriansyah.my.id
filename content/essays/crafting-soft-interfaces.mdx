# Crafting Soft Interfaces

## Begin with felt sense

A soft interface is less about rounded corners and more about how a flow respects the user's energy. Before I push pixels, I script the emotional states I want the experience to evoke: assurance, curiosity, relief.

## Rhythm over novelty

Animation is conversation. Instead of one-off flourishes, I choreograph rhythm—micro-delays that let a gesture feel intentional. The goal is quiet confidence, not spectacle.

- Lead the eye using staggered reveals.
- Prefer easing curves that mirror breathing.
- Hide the scaffolding until someone asks for it.

## Language as interface

Words are the smallest UI components. I rewrite prompts until they sound like a teammate offering help, not a modal issuing commands.<Footnote label="Tone">Warm, specific, and slightly poetic.</Footnote>

Softness is a design stance. It reminds me that software should feel like a calm room, not a barrage of notifications.
