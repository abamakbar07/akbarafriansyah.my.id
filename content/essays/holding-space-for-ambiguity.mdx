# Learning in Public Logistics

I learn best by mixing practice with reflection. Warehouse leadership during the day, data science studies at night, and small shipping rituals in between. This essay maps how I keep curiosity from burning out.

## Study plans with a pulse

- Weekly deep dives into applied statistics and SQL performance tuning.
- Python lab sessions where I rebuild logistics scenarios with Pandas and Scikit-learn.
- RAG experiments using Supabase embeddings and Upstash Vector to keep AI knowledge retrieval grounded in real documentation.

## Mentors in philosophy and faith

I draw inspiration from Rocky Gerung’s critical reasoning and the reflective practices rooted in my Muslim faith. Together they keep my thinking honest, ethical, and open to debate.

## Sharing the journey

Documenting wins and missteps through essays, talks with peers in the Supervisor Development Program, and family conversations keeps learning communal. Transparency invites better questions—and better questions are the true accelerant of growth.
