# Holding Space for Ambiguity

## Ambiguity is a design partner

Every complex project begins with fog. When a question refuses to resolve, I give it room instead of forcing an early answer. Ambiguity keeps the team curious long enough to discover signals we would otherwise miss.

> I treat unclear inputs as invitations to map assumptions, not as blockers to progress.

## A cadence of discovery

I run bi-weekly "sensemaking" sessions with collaborators. We gather field notes, highlight what we still do not know, and celebrate the clues that moved us forward.<Footnote label="Sensemaking">The practice of aligning perspectives before making an irreversible decision.</Footnote>

1. Capture everything without editing.
2. Cluster evidence into tensions.
3. Propose the smallest next experiment.

## Designing with softer edges

Most of my product explorations start in Figma but end as interactive notebooks. The format lets me pair narrative, interaction, and instrumentation without losing context.

Ambiguity feels less threatening when every experiment is reversible.
