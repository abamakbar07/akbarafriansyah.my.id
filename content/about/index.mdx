# Hello, I’m Akbar

I was born in 1998 in Indonesia, grew up curious about systems, and eventually found my rhythm in the warehouse floors of PT DSV Solutions Indonesia. Today I serve as a Warehouse Admin & SAP Specialist, partnering closely with Ericsson on projects like EID, IoH, and PDU. My work lives in the overlap of meticulous SAP MM/WMS execution and the human choreography that keeps 3PL logistics steady.

## What I do every day

- Coordinate nationwide Stock Take Operations (STO) so every site speaks the same data language.
- Execute SAP transactions—GR, GI, OBD, 311 MIGO—and reconcile MB52 exports with WMS reality.
- Build calm reporting workflows with Excel, VBA macros, and Python automation.
- Share learnings with peers as part of DSV’s Supervisor Development Program (SDP-11).

## Technical backbone

My academic roots are in Computer Systems Networking & Telecommunications, but I’ve always looked for ways to blend infrastructure thinking with modern tooling.

- **Front-end:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS.
- **Back-end & databases:** Node.js, Supabase, Firebase, PostgreSQL, MySQL.
- **Automation:** Python (Pandas, ETL flows) and good old VBA.
- **Deployment:** Vercel, GitHub Actions, Docker basics when needed.

## Personal projects that keep me honest

I believe in building for real use. These are a few playgrounds where logistics, data, and delight meet:

- **StockFlow** — a PWA that pairs SAP data with on-ground STO checks.
- **Personal Finance Tracker** — a budgeting dashboard with CSV/TSV imports and Supabase storage.
- **BC Wash Sukarame** — an operations dashboard helping a local car wash visualise throughput.
- **Validation Tools** — Python/VBA scripts that flag anomalies across WMS reports.
- **Wedding App Template** — a modern invitation with RSVP tracking and QR codes.
- **Family Gacha THR Game** — a playful generator that keeps Eid celebrations lively.

## The learning arc

I’m currently deepening my analytics toolkit on the path toward data science. The focus areas:

- Applied statistics and meaningful data visualisation.
- SQL query optimisation that respects warehouse realities.
- Machine learning basics using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
- Retrieval-augmented generation experiments with Upstash Vector and Supabase embeddings.

## How I think and work

I’m an INTP—analytical, independent, and happiest when I can test ideas against reality. I admire the critical thinking of Rocky Gerung, and I try to match that clarity in my own explanations. Faith grounds me, curiosity fuels me, and humour keeps collaboration generous. I don’t chase perfection; I focus on meaningful improvement that serves the team and the communities I belong to.
